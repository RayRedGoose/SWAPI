### Expectations / Spec

Build a React App that pulls Star Wars trivia from an API and displays it in multiple interative pages.  For this, we needed to learn how to access and control data from another server, and perform multiple nested fetches to do so.

Tasks:
- Create components and pass info between them.
- Create a form that takes in info added by a user and displays errors when the info is not present or incorrectly formatted
- Pull a list of Star Wars movies from the API and display them in order by episode.  Manipulate the fetched data to display the required information.
- Each movie card needs a button that fetches all characters from that movie, as well as nested data from each of those URL's
- User must be able to navigate back to the movies page from the characters page
- User must be allowed to favorite characters and see them in a new URL endpoint.

## Learning Goals

- Increase comfort level with building multiple components in React, passing data and methods using state and props
- Introduce the use of Router to navigate between different URL's, and allow the user to manually type in URL's if necessary.  Handle any routes that do not exist with a 404.
- Familiarize use of nested API's and Promise.all()
- Practice testing with Jest and Enzyme, and become familiar with async testing.
